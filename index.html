        <p>
          I'm a third year student studying Digital Media <br />at UCF. Here is
          some of my work:

                My family has always pushed me to follow my passion and be the
                best I can be. My late grandfather has always been my greatest
                role model; he supported my art and taught me the importance of
                listening to your intuition. I chose to attend UCF in order to
                stay close to my family. I am also a first generation student,
                and will be the first person in my family to earn a degree.

                At a very young age, I discovered my creativity. I would draw
                and paint everyday. I never thought it would lead me to my
                career but after examining my passions and choices, I realized
                Web Design would allow me to take that creativity and combine it
                with my other strenghts. By applying my natural talents and
                expanding my knowledge, I believe this career path is perfect
                for me.

                During my time at Seminole State College, I took some graphic
                design courses that introduced me to the world of digital media.
                I realized that I love both coding and design and wanted to
                combine the two to find a career that suits me best. My goal is
                to be a front end developer but also capable of designing the
                brand and website myself. My favorite type of design is that
                that focuses on natural elements (such as organic shapes and
                materials.)

                At the age of 17, I moved across the Atlantic on my own to live
                in the Netherlands as I explored Europe. I realized one of the
                best feelings, to me, is exploring a new place and meeting new
                people. Cities, small towns, mountains, or beaches; I love
                exploring the world around me. When I learned there was a way to
                combine travel and work by becoming a digital nomad, I realized
                that was what I wanted in life.
