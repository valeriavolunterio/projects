            The emergence of graphic art deco is best represented by French
            poster artist <strong>Georges Lepape</strong>. Evoking the art
            nouveau movement, Lepape transformed book covers, magazines,
            playbills, and more. In fact, he designed some of the most iconic
            cover art for <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Vanity Fair</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="image__description">
            As the Art Deco movement morphed in the 1920s, French artists who
            define the period include <strong>Paul Colin</strong> and
            <strong>Jean Carlu</strong>. The former created renowned posters for
            Josephine Baker, an American Entertainer.
          </p>
          <p class="image__description">
            Carlu's influence dominated in theatre, soaps, and movie posters,
            including Charlie Chaplin. In the 1930s and 40s, his focus in
            design, along with most other Art Deco artists, shifted towards the
            war and promoting tourism.

            Although the Art Deco period had a wide influence in many different
            forms, including architecture and art, some of the most influential
            uses of this were in the graphic arts. Art Deco appeared early on in
            the development of posters and magazines, therefore creating some of
            the most renowned covers and promotional tourism.
          </p>
          <p class="image__description">
            One such poster is <em>L'Atlantique</em> by artist
            <strong>A.M. Cassandre</strong>. This poster embodies the elegance
            and grandeur that the Art Deco movement emphasized when advertising
            travels. The bold, geometric wall representing the ship illustrates
            it as nearly a wall trasversing through the Atlantic.

          <p class="image__description">
            The Art Deco movement's influence in architecture, fashion, and
            design can still be seen today. Many iconic buildings from the time
            are still standing and demand the viewer's attention in their
            grandiosity. However, the graphic arts of the time are particularly
            interesting as their shift in focus and design are particularly
            connected to our history.
          </p>
          <p class="image__description">
            The first Art Deco graphic art can be seen leading up to World War
            I. The posters focused on the lavish elegance of ballets and fashion
            of the time. Then, in the 1920's, as fashion evolved to become more
            casual and daring, so too did the posters; fashion magazines
            featuring this type of aesthetic quickly popularized the style in
            America.
          </p>
          <p class="image__description">
            During the Great Depression in the 1930s, designs shifted focus to
            promote tourism and cultural events. Many artists, including Jean
            Carlu, also shifted their focus on war efforts and patriotic posters
            during the second World War.
